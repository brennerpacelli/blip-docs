## Desk

The **desk** extension allows routing and exchange of messages and notifications between bot users and human agents. The human agents can reply the messages using any BLiP supported help desk application ([BLiP Desk](https://desk.blip.ai) for instance). Hence, a bot can forward received messages from users to a **human agent** on the chosen help desk application and vice versa, in a transparent way.

This feature is useful for **enabling humans to reply some complex or unhandled messages as the bot**. For example, imagine that you want a chatbot that knows a lot about soccer teams, but for some reason it doesn't know exactly the tickets prices for some matchs. In this scenario, you can use a human to help the bot answer only when users ask about ticket prices.

*Note: BLiP offers [BLiP Desk](https://desk.blip.ai), a free and powerful desk application to enable humans to reply messages sent by a bot.*

Before using this extension, check if you have already properly set a customer service tool (help desk application) on the Portal and if you already have at least one available human agent to receive and reply to messages.

### Create a ticket for an attendance

Before start to attendance some user is necessary first open a ticket.
To open a ticket send a command with `SET` method to `postmaster@desk.msging.net` and URI `/tickets/{customerIdentity}`, where `customerIdentity` is the customer identity to be attended. Use the `resource` property to delivery a context for the ticket.

```
POST https://msging.net/commands HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Key {YOUR_TOKEN}
```
```json
{
  "id": "89e18743",
  "to": "postmaster@desk.msging.net",
  "method": "set",
  "uri": "/tickets/ba11b95c-7564-4685-b835-8cc76fae6fac.testehome1%400mn.io",
  "type": "text/plain",
  "resource": "I need a human!"
}
```

Server responds with ticked created

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
    "type": "application/vnd.iris.ticket+json",
    "resource": {
        "id": "89e18743-ee13-498e-a8a8-de5e8a7da846",
        "sequentialId": 1,
        "ownerIdentity": "testehome1@msging.net",
        "customerIdentity": "ba11b95c-7564-4685-b835-8cc76fae6fac.testehome1@0mn.io",
        "customerDomain": "0mn.io",
        "provider": "Lime",
        "status": "Waiting",
        "storageDate": "2018-07-05T18:55:59.660Z",
        "externalId": "89e18743-ee13-498e-a8a8-de5e8a7da846",
        "rating": 0,
        "team": "Default",
        "unreadMessages": 0,
        "closed": false
    },
    "method": "set",
    "status": "success",
    "id": "89e18743",
    "from": "postmaster@desk.msging.net/#az-iris1",
    "to": "testehome1@msging.net"
}
```

### Forwarding received messages to a human agent

>Imagine a scenario where a user on Messenger channel asks for human help service. Therefore, while the ticket is still open, any message received by the bot should be sent to a **human agent**.

At first, the bot receives a message and decides if it must route the user to a human agent. Imagine for instance that the message **"Hello, I would like to talk to an attendant."** is enough to send the user to an agent.

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "from": "1654804277843415@messenger.gw.msging.net",
    "to": "bot@msging.net/instance",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "content": "Hello, I would like to talk to an attendant."
}
```

To foward a received message to an agent, send the message to **{encoded-user-node}@desk.msging.net**, where

**{encoded-user-node}** is the ASCII-encoded messages' emmiter node.

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "from": "bot@msging.net/instance",
    "to": "1654804277843415%40messenger.gw.msging.net@desk.msging.net",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "content": "Hello, I would like to talk to an attendant."
}
```

### Forwarding received messages from a human agent to a final user

>Imagine a scenario where a human agent is replying to some message to a user on Messenger channel. The message received by the bot from the human agent must be fowarded to the final user.

First, the bot receives a message as below:

```json
{
    "id": "2",
    "from": "1654804277843415%40messenger.gw.msging.net@desk.msging.net",
    "to": "bot@msging.net/instance",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "content": "Hello, here is a human being ;)"
}
```

To forward a received message to the specific final user, the bot must decode the received message node so it knows where to respond **{encoded-user-node}@desk.msging.net**:

```json
{
    "id": "2",
    "from": "bot@msging.net/instance",
    "to": "1654804277843415@messenger.gw.msging.net",
    "type": "text/plain",
    "content": "Hello, here is a human being ;)"
}
```

### Handling the end of an attendance

>When the human agent closes some attendance the bot receives a message with a *Redirect* content type. The Redirect's context property has a *Ticket* with information about the attendance. In order to get a closed attendance information, add a receiver to **application/vnd.lime.redirect+json** content type.

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "to": "54f1dd2e-42d2-43f2-9100-68fbbabb9c83@tunnel.msging.net",
    "type": "application/vnd.lime.redirect+json",
    "content": {
        "context": {
            "type": "application/vnd.iris.ticket+json",
            "value": {
                "id": "1654804277843415",
                "sequentialId": 0,
                "ownerIdentity": "bot@msging.net",
                "customerIdentity": "1654804277843415@messenger.gw.msging.net",
                "agentIdentity": "ravpacheco%40gmail.com@blip.ai",
                "status": "ClosedAttendant",
                "storageDate": "2018-03-20T20:41:54.330Z",
                "externalId": "3cf18133-7b0f-47d2-8719-bbaec6ee14e4",
                "rating": 0,
                "team": "Default",
                "unreadMessages": 0
            }
        }
    }
}
```

After receiving the Redirect message, the bot can change the user state and start to handle next messages automatically.

### Closing an ticket as the user

Sometimes may be interesting allow the users close the ticket when they want. To make this possible send a command with `SET` method to `postmaster@desk.msging.net` URI `/tickets/change-status` and resource with ticket `id` and `status` with **ClosedClient**.

```
POST https://msging.net/commands HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Key {YOUR_TOKEN}
```
```json
{
  "id": "fbfd62ac",
  "to": "postmaster@desk.msging.net",
  "method": "set",
  "uri": "/tickets/change-status",
  "type": "application/vnd.iris.ticket+json",
  "resource": {
  	"id": "fbfd62ac-1dcc-404b-b174-a8f60ccf8659",
  	"status": "ClosedClient"
  }
}
```

    "to": "testehome1@msging.net"
}
```

### Finishing a tickets previously closed by customer

The proccess of close a ticket is the last thing to do during an attendance. If a ticket is closed by the customer is possible close permanently to unable any data update. In order to finalize permanently a ticket send a command with `SET` method to `postmaster@desk.msging.net` and URI `/tickets/{ticketId}/close` .

```
POST https://msging.net/commands HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Key {YOUR_TOKEN}
```
```json
{
  "id": "123219310318",

	"ownerIdentity": "{botIdentifier}@msging.net",
	"status": "ClosedClient",
